# Upcycle YYC

## Project Description

In the past 50 years, Calgarians have thrown out 40 MILLION tonnes of trash -- that's equivalent to 4,000 Calgary Towers!
As one of Canada’s fastest growing cities, the cost of operating and maintaining landfills have skyrocketed and is estimated to cost $1.25 Billion over the next 25 years, and finding new landfills sites is nearly impossible.
Landfills also contain valuable resources that could’ve been recycled, reused or composted.
Since the launch of the Green Bin program, It is estimated that this program will divert 85 million KG per year from landfills – this is one of the ways City councilors plan to reach their goal to divert 70% of waste from landfills by 2025.
But how can we reach this goal sooner?

Our solution is to gamify waste management and create incentives for Calgarians. This will help the city reduce and divert waste from landfills, save tax payer money and educate Calgarians on proper waste disposal. 

Upcycle is a fictitious application that has partnered with the City of Calgary to reward Calgarians who exemplify environmentally friendly practices. Users will earn rewards based upon a point system forEach item they have accurately disposed of.

A ranking system was created that populates on the Upcycle Leaderboard Page. This allows the user to view the top ranked users in the city and the top ranked wards in the city.
